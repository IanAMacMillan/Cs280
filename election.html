            WASHINGTON D.C.-- Hundreds of students at American University gathered for a protest to voice their anger on Wednesday after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president" class="boldlink"> Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.</a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The protest started when students began burning small American flags in front of the student center. Students quickly gathered after word spread on social media. Soon, there were about five hundred students gathered to watch Trump supporters defend the president elect from Clinton supporters.

            <a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Group-Burns-American-Flag-American-University-Campus-400593301.html" class="boldlink"> Local TV stations</a> began to arrive and interview students and film the final stages of the demonstration. The protest started to thin after plain clothed police officers were called to keep the peace. Hours after people had started to gather, members of the Center of Diversity and Inclusion helped make sure everyone started to disperse.

            “Students on campus reacted very rashly,” Said Valerie Ciskowski, a student in American’s College of Arts of Science. “They let their emotions take over and acted without thinking about the consequences. Although burning the flag is technically protected speech, it is still very disrespectful. I mean there were veterans watching. I would not want a video of myself burning an American flag to be all over the major news networks.”

            Many American University students and alumni voiced outrage about the flag burning at Wednesdays protest that has attracted national attention. Just days after the incident, American University President Neil Kerwin addressed the university community, which only happens a few times a year.

            <p>
            “The university in no way condones, promotes, or supports the burning of the American flag,” said Kerwin in an <a href="http://www.american.edu/president/announcements/November-11-2016.cfm" class="boldlink">email to students.</a> “it is an act of profound disrespect that left many members of our community outraged, deeply offended, and disappointed. I ask every member of our community to help maintain that standard of civil discourse more broadly at our university.”
            </p>

            Students at the prominently liberal university felt that they needed to express their shock and sadness when Donald Trump claimed victory over the much favored Hillary Clinton. Every prominent media outlet had predicted Secretary Clinton would win the election by a large margin.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            “I was certain that Hillary was going to become the first female president of the United States,” said Emily Chipps, a sophomore at American University. “When I found out that Donald Trump was going to be the next president, I cried. I couldn’t understand how the U.S. could have voted for such a horrible person. It’s sort of expected that the university would react in such an emotional way because this is a very political campus.”
            </p>

            Protests on campus and around the country have slowly started to subside as liberals have started to accept the reality of a Trump presidency. Although many liberal students are still upset about Clintons defeat, tensions are beginning to die down. American University urges students who find themselves still feeling upset to contact the student counseling center.
